# aiproject

Simple prompt generator for research support. Use the dropdown to choose the
desired prompt type and fill out the form fields. For Literature Review and
Analytical Framework prompts you can either paste the text directly or select
the *Upload file* option. When selecting file upload, only the research question
is entered and the generated prompt will instruct the AI to analyze the document you upload to the AI chat.
The Formal Aspects check requires no additional inputâ€”generate the prompt and upload your document to the AI to receive formatting feedback.
