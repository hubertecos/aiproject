## Educational Context

### Learning Objectives

This tool helps students understand:

- Whether their work meets basic academic requirements
- How to structure research arguments effectively
- What constitutes appropriate evidence and reasoning
- How to prepare for productive professor consultations

### AI Integration Philosophy

The tool embodies a responsible approach to AI in education:

- **Enhancement, not replacement**: AI feedback supplements, doesn‚Äôt replace, human expertise
- **Educational transparency**: Students understand they‚Äôre using AI assistance
