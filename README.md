Simple prompt generator for research support. Use the dropdown to choose the
desired prompt type and fill out the form fields. For the combined **Literature
Review and Analytical Framework** prompt you can either paste the text directly
or select the *Upload file* option. When selecting file upload, only the research question is entered and the generated prompt will instruct the AI to analyze the document you upload to the AI chat.
The Formal Aspects check requires no additional inputâ€”simply click **Copy Prompt to Clipboard** and upload your document to the AI to receive formatting feedback.
